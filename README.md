## Final project delivery

My proposal is to add more components and funcionalities to my last delivery P5 where I developed a simple forum where all messages were saved in a json file.

My goal is to consolidate the knowledge learned during the course

## Developed points

- Authenticated
- Add SQLite database with Turso
- Use more components from the shadcn library
- Error control
- Function or page to create new forums
- Function or page to create new users
- Implementation of roles with different levels of privileges, administrator, normal user, etc.
- Deploy the website with Vercel (https://my-forum-app-beta.vercel.app/)

## Improvements to be developed in a second step outside the scope of the project delivery

- Data validation with ZOD
- Improved user creation with email validation without admin user intervention
- Implement roles properly by adding role type in the database in the users table
- Add more features to the admin role such as: Deleting messages and forums from the database directly from the web, etc.
