## Final project delivery

My proposal is to add more components and funcionalities to my last delivery P5 where I developed a simple forum where all messages were saved in a json file.

My goal is to consolidate the knowledge learned during the course

## Points to develop

- Authenticated
- Add SQLite database with Turso
- Use more components from the shadcn library
- Error control and data validation with ZOD
- Add the creation of more than one forum
- Deploy the website with Vercel

under developing....
